# goggles_core

Core engine and modules for Goggles 5.0+

This _full_ engine should contain only:

- models
- strategies
- decorators
- other pattern objects (services, proxies, whatever...)
- current DB structure
- **NO** DB data
- full specs for all the above
- versioning info for the DB & core modules & overall framework release
- only the basic Rake tasks for DB rebuild/backup using (externally supplied) data dumps
