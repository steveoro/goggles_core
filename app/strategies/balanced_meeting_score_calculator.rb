# == BalancedMeetingScoreCalculator
#
# Strategy Pattern implementation for csi 23014-2015 "balanced"
# meeting team score calculation
# The "balanced" method is the sum of:
# - all individual meeting points
# - best team relays (for category and gender)
# - bonus points for "missing" athlets
# - bonus points for "missing" relays
# The bonus points are calculated:
# - for athlets on the numeber of team athelts
#   to the number of athlets of the most numerous team
# - for relays on the number of team relays considederd
#   to the maximum number of relays considered for a team
